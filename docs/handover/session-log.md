# Session Log

Use this for meaningful checkpoints only.

## 2026-03-29

### Entry 1
- Completed production validation for cron endpoints and login availability.
- Updated production env alignment for URL/CORS consistency.
- Follow-up: activate Checkly checks and alerts.

### Entry 2
- Introduced canonical app URL resolver and updated auth/waitlist/email usage.
- Added Checkly setup guidance.
- Follow-up: migrate to final domain via env-only change when ready.

### Entry 3
- Rebuilt documentation governance structure across project/architecture/engineering/integrations/product.
- Removed stale and agent-specific prompt/handoff documents.
- Follow-up: keep `project-status` and `handover/current-state` synchronized every meaningful change.

### Entry 4
- Created persistent handover system in `docs/handover/` with overview, state, next steps, operating rules, constraints, context map, and this log.
- Follow-up: contributors must update handover files during execution, not only at session end.

### Entry 5
- Audited booking journey readiness on professional side against code reality.
- Confirmed gap: advanced `professional_settings` are implemented in backend reads but not exposed in professional UI for editing.
- Follow-up: implement dedicated professional booking settings page before deeper booking lifecycle expansion.

### Entry 6
- Delivered professional booking settings UI at `/configuracoes-agendamento` with save flow to `professional_settings`.
- Added direct navigation links from `/perfil` and `/disponibilidade` to advanced booking settings.
- Validation completed with `typecheck` and `lint` (only pre-existing lint warnings remained).

### Entry 7
- Added Sentry instrumentation baseline (client/server/edge init + global error capture + booking server-action error capture).
- Added PostHog baseline (provider, auth events, booking funnel events, route pageviews).
- Updated canonical schema snapshot `db/sql/schema/supabase-schema.sql` through migration `006`.
- Improved professional agenda to expose pending confirmation SLA/deadline context.
- Added Playwright e2e baseline (`playwright.config.ts`, `tests/e2e/booking-critical.spec.ts`, `npm run test:e2e`).
- Follow-up: activate Sentry/PostHog in production env and validate dashboards/alerts.
